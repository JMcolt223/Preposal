# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

We haven't thought of a plot for our novel yet, but one of my name ideas are "Who will you save?"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I want to make a intriguing visual novel game. I want it to leave you on the edge of your seat just dying to continue reading. I'm not sure of a plot yet, but I do want it to be in the thriller genre. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will use renpy to create a visual novel game. It will have multiple different endings and the player will have the ability to make many choices throughout the story to make it more interesting. I will ask my partners Makiyah and Caden to help write different parts of the script and maybe help me draw a thing or two. My biggest aspect of the game will be the ability to choose your ending based of off your choices and being able to replay the game to get the desired outcome. To make the sprites I found a sprite maker called LibreSprite. This is how I will create assets and characters. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

"Makiyah Skye Jones" <makiyah.jones@temple.edu> TA Yihan
"Caden Maurice Diggs" <caden.diggs@temple.edu> TA is David Chester

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I want to have a story with more than one ending. At least two would be great. That's one thing I absolutely want to include. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I would like all the characters to be drawn by me and same for the backgrounds. I think I can make a lot of different story lines to make the game  more interesting. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I want a fun, suspenseful visual novel game that has many different ending options. I want everything to be customized such as buttons and script boxes. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First, I will figure out renpy. I need to figure out how to make sprites and how to customize everything about the game. I will need to look up tutorials for renpy and teach myself how it works. Next, I need to research ideas for the story. My classmates and I are trying to come up with ideas for a suspenseful story with different endings. That is our biggest task right now is trying to get creative with these story ideas, but also making it possible to create. Caden and Makiyah will help write scripts for the story and they will help me draw some stuff I need such as text boxes and button designs. After I do all this, it won't be hard to complete this project.
